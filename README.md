# third party amazon

Amazon-like storefront via terminal using Node.js and MySQL. This CLI-app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory using a MySQL database.

### Prerequisites

```
required node packages: `mysql`, `inquirer`
```

You will also need to set up a mySQL database. I did this via mySQL Workbench. Refer to `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files for creating and structuring your database.

```
optional node packages: `cli-table` (makes the table pretty), `dotenv` (to hide your database info)
```

### Installing

```
npm install...
```

example:

```
npm install mysql
```
